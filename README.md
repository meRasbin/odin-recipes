# odin-recipes
This project is to build on practicing my basic HTML knowledge that I have learned while doing the Odin project. I will be building a basic recipe website that will have a main index page which will have a few links to a few recipes. Some Nepalese foods included.

After completing this project, I will have accomplished:

Properly seting up and linking html files togrther
Inputed images with alternative text
Created ordered and unordered lists for the steps and recipes and also adding notes to cook
Added a Home/main page button on recipes sites to go back to starting page
used body and paragraph elements to describe what the recipe is all about
Linked a CSS stylesheet to the HTML files
Properly implemented various types of CSS selectors and inheritance, keeping in mind of specificity rules.
