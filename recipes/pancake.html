    <img src="images/pancakes.jpeg">
    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>A pancake (or hot-cake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter.</p>

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>2 eggs, separated</li>
             <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
             <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
             <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
             <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
             <li>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
             <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
             <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
             
        
         </ul>

         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form.</li>
             <li>Butter enough 3 1/2-inch ring molds to fill your frying pan. Place molds in the pan over low heat. Cover.</li>
             <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl.</li>
             <li>Combine buttermilk, egg yolks, butter, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl.
                 Add the flour mixture and stir until batter is fairly smooth.</li>
             <li>Fold egg whites into the batter until combined. Small bits of egg whites still showing is ok.</li>
             <li>Pour about 1/2 cup of batter into each mold and cover the pan.
                 Cook until bubbles start forming at the top, about 5 minutes.
                 Flip pancakes in their molds and cook until set, 3 to 4 minutes more.</li>
             
             
         </ol>
